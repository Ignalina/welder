# Welder
Trying out different streaming jobs to read avro from kafka and output to hive/parquet or iceberg/parquet.

Goals with this is to learn howto read from kafka with multiple partitions/offsets and spread out the work to multiple workers.
The name Welder is the opposite from the Shredder , since the welder it makes the data "whole again" (Hopefully)
